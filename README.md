# HTML and CSS Collage Remix - Assignment 4

## Version Control and Collaboration :computer: :art:

This original project was a web collage created with gifs, videos, static imagery, and music. I decided to create a project that featured a psychedelic art museum and the song Peace by the group Chon.
